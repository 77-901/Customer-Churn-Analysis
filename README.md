# Customer Churn Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in a telecommunications company. Churn, in this context, refers to the rate at which customers leave or stop using a service over a given time period. Understanding churn is crucial for businesses as it helps them identify factors that contribute to customer attrition and develop strategies to retain them.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains information about various customers, including their demographic details, services subscribed, contract details, and churn status.

### Attributes
- customerID
- gender
- SeniorCitizen
- Partner
- Dependents
- tenure
- PhoneService
- MultipleLines
- InternetService ... (and more)
### Total Records: 7043

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

### Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Python code for loading, exploring, and preparing the dataset. This includes extracting relevant information, handling missing values, and converting data types.

### Data Visualization
Visualizations depicting distribution and relationships among various attributes.

### Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) providing insights into customer churn behavior.

### Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Linear Regression

### Results and Discussion
Evaluation metrics for each model. Recommendations based on the analysis.

### Code
The code is written in Python and utilizes libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, visualization, and model building.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into customer churn behavior and presents machine learning models to predict and mitigate it. The analysis can be used to formulate targeted marketing strategies and improve customer retention efforts.
